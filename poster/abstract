Plasmids are independently reproducing segments of DNA. Through transformation,
bacterial cells can acquire a plasmid and its associated trait at some fitness
cost to the cell.
Here, we investigate the effect of different rates of cellular transformation
from plasmids encoding for antibiotic resistance on growth of well mixed
populations of antibiotic-susceptible and resistant bacteria. A computer simulation
is used to examine population dynamics that would not otherwise be apparent
through mathematical modeling. By exploring the parameter space of the two major
parameters, ratio of birth rates of the populations and the rate of transformation,
we were able to identify the parameter ranges where the populations break even,
and where one dominates the other.

- Plasmids can give drug resistance to a bacteria, at the cost to
the bacteria's fitness.
