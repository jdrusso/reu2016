Plasmids are independently reproducing segments of DNA. Through transformation,
bacterial cells can acquire a plasmid and its associated trait at some fitness
cost to the cell.
Here, we investigate the effect of different rates of cellular transformation
from plasmids encoding for antibiotic resistance on growth of well mixed
populations of antibiotic-susceptible and resistant bacteria. A computer simulation
is used to examine population dynamics that would not otherwise be apparent
through mathematical modeling. By exploring the parameter space of the two major
parameters, ratio of birth rates of the populations and the rate of transformation,
we were able to identify the parameter ranges where the populations break even,
and where one dominates the other.

Bacteria developing antibiotic resistance is a ubiquitous threat. We plan to study
the effect of different rates of transformation on emergence of antibiotic
resistance due to plasmids. Plasmids are small, independently replicating
chunks of genetic material, in this case coding for antibiotic resistance. A
cell can absorb a plasmid through transformation, adding the plasmid's trait to
its own genetic information. This comes with a small fitness cost, as the cell
will take longer to reproduce the added genetic information. However, in the presence
of antibiotics, increased survivability is worth the fitness cost. We used a combined approach
of Kinetic Monte Carlo and mathematical modeling methods to explore a parameter
space including growth and death rates, transformation rates, and plasmid
availability. We focused on the effects of differential growth and transformation,
finding that whether the susceptible or resistant population wins out is
heavily dependent on transformation rate.
